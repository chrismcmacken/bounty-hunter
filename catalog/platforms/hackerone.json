    {"target": "digili.s-cloud.fi Services for S-Bank and S-group customers where customers can take S-bank basic banking services into use (later \"digipa\") and gain S-Group co-op membership (later \"digili).     Basic banking services include opening an account and setting it as a benefit services account, applying for Visa Debit-card and opening and ordering net bank credentials that can be used as logging into S-bank netbank and using credentials to identify oneself in digital environments.    Digili and Digipa are different applications but they are built on top of same services. Difference Between Digili and Digipa is that in Digili user opens S-group co-op membership before opening basic banking services. In Digipa user can open banking services directly without the need to gain S-group co-op membership. In case user doesn’t have required co-op membership s/he is directed to Digili application.    If user has already co-op membership and s/he enters Digili, user will be forwarded to open banking services. In case user has some of the offered basic banking services in use, the step is skipped and user is shown a possibility to open the missing services.    Digili and Digipa applications can be entered through https://www.s-pankki.fi/fi/tule-asiakkaaksi/, https://www.s-kanava.fi/asiakaspalvelu/nain-liityt/ or taking S-mobiili into use as a non- S-group co-op member where user is directed automatically to Digili to gain S-group co-op membership that is a requirement to take S-mobiili into use.    In order to access Digili or Digipa user needs to be able to authenticate himself/hersef with Finnish banking credentials or through Mobiilivarmenne.  User need also to fulfill following requirements in order to be able to access the service:  - Needs to be 18 years of age  - Needs to have Finnish social security number  - Needs to have permanent street address in Finland    In case user is not a S-group co-op member there is a minimum of 20€ membership payment that needs to be made during the process.

We are interested in hearing about cases where running ESLint on attacker-supplied source file, with an attacker-supplied set of JSON rule/parser option/environment configurations, could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary or unexpected code. For example, the [demo](https://eslint.org/demo/) on `eslint.org` runs ESLint in the user's browser, with the source code and configuration specified in the URL hash. Some of our users also host services that can be used to lint untrusted code. An attack of this nature would likely indicate a [reflected cross-site scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) vulnerability on `eslint.org`, and similar vulnerabilities on other sites that run ESLint on user-supplied input.    Other potential security vulnerabilities in ESLint are also in scope, but note that most aspects of ESLint are not security-sensitive. For example ESLint allows the user to load plugins and JavaScript config files, which are executed during a lint run. As a result, a malicious config file or plugin could compromise the user's system. However, we don't consider this to be an issue specific to ESLint; in general, it's important that a user doesn't run untrusted third-party code on a system.    For bugs in ESLint which don't have a security impact, please create an issue [here](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/new?template=BUG_REPORT.md) instead.", "url": "https://hackerone.com/eslint", "paid": false},

    {"target": "https://github.com/endojs/endo/tree/master/packages/ses Hardened JavaScript is a tamper-proof JavaScript environment that allows safe execution of arbitrary programs in Compartments. It is the foundation of Agoric smart contracts.     Hardened JavaScript:   * Is a JavaScript runtime library for safely running third-party code.  * Addresses JavaScript’s lack of internal security, as JavaScript applications use and rely on third-party code (modules, packages, libraries, user-provided code for extensions and plug-ins, etc.).  * Enforces best practices by removing hazardous features such as global mutable state and lack of encapsulation in sloppy mode.  * Is a safe deterministic subset of “strict mode” JavaScript.  * Does not include any IO objects that provide [ambient authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_authority).  * Removes non-determinism by modifying a few built-in objects.  * Adds functionality to freeze and make immutable both built-in JavaScript objects and program-created objects and make them immutable.    Helpful resources include:  * [HardenedJS/SES guide](https://agoric.com/documentation/guides/js-programming/ses/ses-guide.html#what-is-ses)  * [Hardened JS/SES reference](https://agoric.com/documentation/guides/js-programming/ses/ses-reference.html#lockdown-and-harden)  * [Purple Team Vulnerability Assessment](https://agoric.com/blog/technology/metamask-agoric-hardened-js-security-review/)    During a collaborative bug-hunting exercise with Agoric’s code maintainers, the MetaMask team identified the targets listed below as potential hot spots for issues in the code.     * The evaluate function, including any of the transforms it performs, like re-inserting comments into trusted scope.  * Exploring ways of acquiring the scope handler from within a Compartment. While this was possible using Firefox debug tools, developer tools were out of scope for this assessment, and no other approach was found.  * Experimenting with the ScopeProxy (which is reifiable) to try to get its feral eval function from it.  * Explore the implications of the Compartment constructor and evaluator tripping get and have traps on the object it’s given and whether or not a confined script could craft a Proxy to allow re-entrancy and access to feral values.    In addition to this list, the areas outlined below have the potential to yield issues.     ### Non-nested containment    When creating a fully virtualized Linux virtual machine within another fully virtualized virtual machine, a sandbox escape from the second machine should only land you into its creator and not any higher. However in hardened JavaScript, Compartments created by Compartments are “siblings”, both children managed equally by the hardened JavaScript system. Since Compartments running untrusted code can create and configure their own child Compartments, The Compartment must be secure against bad constructor parameters and configuration. If there was a way to create a Compartment configured to disable sandboxing, an attacker could use this to access the start compartment. It may be possible and desirable to implement the shim such that the Compartment implementation is re-defined in the context of the parent compartment, preventing an escape from leading directly to the start compartment.    ### Compartment initialization could be interleaved by Component creator    The compartment initialization logic in the shim is particularly sensitive as it leverages the powerful eval. If an attacker was able to interleave malicious code at the right point during initialization, it may be able to access eval and break out to the start compartment. While this was not an active vulnerability at time of review, introducing this vulnerability only required a small code change. This attack was possible after a small change was introduced to the scopeProxyHandler implementation.     ```  const c = new Compartment()  c.globalThis.__proto__ = new Proxy({}, { has (_, key) { debugger } })  ```     ### Obscure spec pitfalls    Many of the security features of hardened JavaScript depend on core JavaScript functionality, and the ECMAScript specification is so large that even the most capable experts cannot know the spec in its entirety. A fundamental change to JavaScript itself could introduce attack surface or vulnerabilities into hardened JavaScript as uncommon or poorly understood facets of the specification could break assumptions that the security guarantees of hardened JS rely on.     An example of this is present in the hardened JS shim as it relies on the `with` statement. The `with` statement is augmented by a `Symbol.unscopables`  property, which is relatively obscure as it only augments the somewhat deprecated `with` statement. This could allow a breakage from the containment if it was not handled. In this case, JS does handle it. But in the `with ` statement section of the specification, there are no clear references to the `Symbol.unscopables` property and its effect on the `with` statement behavior. Other undocumented behaviors similar to this are likely exist in the specification, and significant changes to the spec that impact behaviors like this could introduce risk or vulnerability into hardened JavaScript.

    {"target": "https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/tree/master/packages/ERTP ERTP (_Electronic Rights Transfer Protocol_) is Agoric’s token standard for digital assets in JavaScript. Using ERTP, you can easily create a wide variety of digital assets, all transferred in the same way and with the same security properties.  ERTP uses object capabilities to enforce access control. If your program has a reference to an object, it can call methods on that object. If it doesn’t have a reference, it can’t.    Before digging into ERTP, it is *vital* that you become familiar with [Hardened JS/SES](https://agoric.com/documentation/guides/js-programming/ses/).    These resources should help you navigate ERTP:     * [ERTP Guide](https://agoric.com/documentation/getting-started/ertp-introduction.html)  * [ERTP API](https://agoric.com/documentation/ertp/api/)  * [Agoric’s JavaScript Programming Guide](https://agoric.com/documentation/guides/js-programming/) includes Agoric-specific additions and deletions to general JavaScript programming that reviewers must know.   * [Vats](https://agoric.com/documentation/guides/js-programming/vats.html) and [Far() and Remotable objects](https://agoric.com/documentation/guides/js-programming/far.html) are of note.   * [Eventual Send](https://agoric.com/documentation/guides/js-programming/eventual-send.html) requires calling `E(object.method)`  for asynchronous communication between ERTP + Zoe. As a result of this, message ordering is important when communicating across vats, especially for ERTP.   * The [assert](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/tree/master/packages/assert), [marshal](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/tree/master/packages/marshal), and [notifier](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/tree/master/packages/notifier) dependencies of the `agoric-sdk` may be necessary for understanding ERTP, but they are not presently within the scope of this program.       ### Security Properties     ERTP purses have a deposit method that takes a payment as its argument. It first checks that the payment is genuine and the same asset brand as the purse  If everything passes the checks, the asset moves from the payment to the purse. If there’s a problem, it throws an error.     After a successful deposit, ERTP guarantees:    * The payment has been deleted from its issuer’s records, and no assets are associated with it.  * Its issuer no longer recognizes that payment.  * The purse contains all digital assets that were in the payment.    When the deposit call throws an error (i.e., something went wrong), ERTP guarantees the purse and the alleged payment were unaffected by that call.    In addition, you can create a _deposit facet_ for any purse. This is an object associated with a specific purse that can be sent to another party instead of referencing the purse. The security advantage is that the other party can only make deposits to the associated purse via the deposit facet. They cannot make a withdrawal from or ask about the balance of a purse via its deposit facet.    Breaking or violating any of these security properties would result in a significant security issue for the Agoric ecosystem, and issues in this code are the highest priority.

    {"target": "https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/tree/master/packages/zoe To help hackers identify avenues of attack or areas of potential weakness, we recommend checking out the [Attacker's Guide to Zoe](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/blob/master/packages/zoe/docs/AttackGuide.md).    Zoe is Agoric’s smart contract framework, which is built on our [Electronic Rights Transfer Protocol (ERTP)](https://agoric.com/documentation/getting-started/ertp-introduction.html). Becoming familiar with the token standard will make navigating and testing the code easier.     Zoe can be used to:    * *Run your code on-chain*  * *Mint new digital assets*  * *Credibly trade assets*    Zoe guarantees offer safety. When a user makes an [offer](https://agoric.com/documentation/glossary/#offer)  and its payments are [escrowed](https://agoric.com/documentation/glossary/#escrow)  with Zoe, Zoe guarantees that the user either gets what they said they wanted or gets back (gets a refund) what they initially offered and escrowed. One reason this is possible is if a  [proposal](https://agoric.com/documentation/glossary/#proposal)  doesn’t match what the contract expects to do, it can immediately cause the  [seat](https://agoric.com/documentation/glossary/#seat)  to exit, getting back the amount it offered.    * [Intro to Zoe](https://agoric.com/documentation/getting-started/intro-zoe.html)  * [Zoe Contracts](https://agoric.com/documentation/zoe/guide/contracts/)  * [Zoe API](https://agoric.com/documentation/zoe/api/)    We are most interested in ensuring that Zoe's security promises and guarantees can not be violated.

    {"target": "http://cloud.konghq.com Kong Konnect is a unified SaaS control plane that allows organizations to manage their API Gateway, Service Mesh, and Ingress Controller deployments globally. The `cloud.konghq.com` application serves as the central command center where users configure services, routes, plugins, and consumer policies.    We invite security researchers to help us protect the integrity of this management console. We are specifically looking for vulnerabilities that could allow unauthorized access to tenant configurations, privilege escalation within an organization, or leakage of sensitive API tokens and credentials.    ## **Target Information**    ### **Primary Scope**  | Asset | Type | Description |  | :--- | :--- | :--- |  | **`cloud.konghq.com`** | Web Application | The core management console for Kong Konnect. This includes the dashboard, Gateway Manager, Mesh Manager, and Service Hub interfaces. |  | **`*.api.konghq.com`** | API Endpoint | The backend API endpoints backing the Konnect web console (used by the UI and CLI). |    ## **Out of Scope & Exclusions**  The following assets and behaviors are strictly **out of scope**. Testing these may result in immediate disqualification.    *   **Customer Data Planes:** `*.edge.gateways.konghq.com`, `*.kongcloud.io`, or any domain representing a customer's specific proxy instance. These are production traffic nodes; attacking them affects our customers' live API traffic.  *   **Marketing & Docs:** `konghq.com` (marketing site), `docs.konghq.com`, and `support.konghq.com`.  *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Any testing that degrades the performance of the control plane or data planes.  *   **Social Engineering:** Phishing employees, support staff, or other customers.    ## **Focus Areas & Vulnerability Categories**  We are particularly interested in critical vulnerabilities that compromise the multi-tenant nature of the platform.    ### **1. Multi-Tenancy & Authorization (Highest Priority)**  *   **Cross-Tenant Access:** Ability to view, modify, or delete configurations (Services, Routes, Plugins) belonging to another organization.  *   **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References):** Accessing objects (e.g., `consumers`, `certificates`, `runtime_groups`) by manipulating IDs in API calls.  *   **Privilege Escalation:** Vertical escalation from a \"Read-Only\" role to an \"Admin\" role within a Konnect Organization.    ### **2. Identity & Session Management**  *   **Authentication Bypasses:** Circumventing SSO (SAML/OIDC) or MFA enforcement.  *   **OAuth/OIDC Flaws:** Improper handling of `state` parameters, redirect URIs, or token leakage in the `us.identity.konghq.com` flow.    ### **3. Injection & Input Validation**  *   **Stored XSS:** Particularly in fields that are rendered in the Developer Portal or shared across team members (e.g., Service descriptions, Plugin configuration fields).  *   **Command Injection:** Attempting to inject shell commands via configuration inputs (though unlikely given the architecture, this is critical if found).  *   **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** Triggering backend requests to internal Kong infrastructure or metadata services via webhooks or alert notification configurations.    ### **4. Sensitive Data Exposure**  *   **Credential Leakage:** Leaking `Client Secrets`, `API Keys`, or `RBAC Tokens` in API responses or frontend JavaScript bundles.  *   **PII Exposure:** Unauthorized access to user emails or profile data of user in different organizations. (Users profile data within the same organization is accessible by design.  )    ## **Qualifying Vulnerabilities**  *   Remote Code Execution (RCE)  *   SQL Injection  *   Broken Access Control (IDOR, Cross-Tenant)  *   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)  *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Stored/Reflected with clear impact)  *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) on state-changing actions  *   Subdomain Takeovers (on in-scope domains only)    ## **Non-Qualifying Issues**  *  Cookie / Authorization  Bearer replacement.  *  Clickjacking on pages with no sensitive actions.  *   Reflected XSS that requires unlikely user interaction (e.g., self-XSS).  *   Missing security headers (CSP, HSTS) without a proof of concept of exploitability.  *   Logout CSRF.  *   Information disclosure of non-sensitive public data (e.g., version numbers).  *   Rate limiting issues (unless they lead to severe resource exhaustion).
